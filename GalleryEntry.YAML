  Our project is a law enforcement training tool. It will allow users to select different types of 
  police officers such as traffic police, campus police, border patrol, and criminal investigator. As the 
  user goes through their selected officer's game, they will be faced with scenarios in an attempt to earn
  points. Within the scenarios, there will be minigames for training and testing purposes. The goal of the 
  tool is to provide an educational platform where users can develop decision-making and critical thinking 
  skills tailored to the unique challenges faced by different types of law enforcement officers.
