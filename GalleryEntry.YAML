  Our project is a law enforcement training tool. It will allow users to select different types of 
  police officers such as traffic police, campus police, and criminal investigator. Each selected officer
  type will have their own unique set of training puzzles and games that will continue to be developed. 
  One example of a training puzzle could be a hypothetical situation where the user will be prompted with
  choices in response to a specific problem where their choices impact the outcome of the situation and 
  generate a score. The goal of the tool is to provide an educational platform where users can develop 
  decision-making and critical thinking skills tailored to the unique challenges faced by different types 
  of law enforcement officers
